# Christmas Tree 🎄

Hey there! This is a fun little console app that prints a cute Christmas tree to spread some holiday cheer. I threw it together because I wanted a quick way to make my terminal more festive.

## How it Works ❄️

It uses some simple logic to print a tree shape out of asterisks (*). Then it randomly scatters snowflake emojis ❄️ around to decorate it.

The snowflakes are generated using the rand() function so it's different every time you run it. Kinda mimics a snowfall!

## Usage 🎁

You'll need a C compiler installed. Then run:

```bash
gcc -o tree tree.c
./tree
```

It'll keep printing new trees every 200ms so it looks like it's snowing.

Feel free to tweak the code and make your own versions! Add lights, garland, whatever.

Have fun and happy holidays! 🎅🎄
