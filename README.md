# Christmas Tree 🎄

This is a fun and festive console application that generates a beautiful Christmas tree. It's a perfect way to bring some holiday cheer to your terminal!

## Features 🌟

- Generates a random Christmas tree in your console.
- The tree is decorated with snowflakes ❄️. (You can change this to any character or emoji you want!)

## How it Works ❄️

The program uses the `rand()` function to randomly place snowflakes and spaces around the Christmas tree. The tree is then printed to the console using a series of `printf()` statements.

## Usage 🎁

To run the program, simply compile it with a C compiler and execute the resulting binary. The program will continuously generate a new Christmas tree every 200 milliseconds, giving the illusion of a snowfall.

```bash
gcc -o tree tree.c
./tree
```

Have a merry Christmas! 🎅🏻
